        <h2>About: </h2><br>
        Ravenclaw is simply 'raven' + 'claw'. A raven is a <b>large black bird</b> that belongs to the crow family. However, Ravenclaw's symbol is an <b>eagle</b>. Ravens and other birds of the corvid family are known to be smart birds and quick learners.
        Ravenclaw's most notable traits are her <b>intelligence</b> and <b>creativity</b>. She valued the same characteristics in her students. Rowena seemed strict and intimidating,but despite this she seemed to be forgiving and loving. This shown by the fact that she was willing to disregard her daughter's betrayal just to see her one last time on her deathbed.
Ravenclaw was very proud, not admitting that her daughter had run away with her diadem not even to her close friends, the other founders. However, she wasn't prejudiced towards those of Muggle parentage or inheritance, as she disagreed with Slytherin's views on admittance to Hogwarts and a large percentage of her house were of Muggle descent.
        <br>
        At some point after her graduation from Hogwarts School, her daughter Helena stole Ravenclaw's diadem, which was said to enhance the wearer's wisdom. Helena was jealous of her mother's famous intellect and took the diadem with her to Albania, far away from her mother's reach, in hopes of surpassing her. Ashamed of her daughter's betrayal, Rowena opted to keep her daughter's treachery a secret from others and denied it even from her fellow founders.
Shortly afterwards, Rowena fell fatally ill. Disregarding her treason, she asked the Baron, who was in love with Helena, to go and find her daughter, merely wishing to see her one last time. He eventually tracked her to a forest in Albania but when she refused to return with him, the Baron flew into a fit of rage, furious at her refusal and envious of her freedom, and stabbed her. Immediately overcome with guilt, he then took his own life. The two would later become, respectively, Ravenclaw and Slytherin house ghosts. Thus, Rowena apparently didn't get the chance to reconcile with her daughter before their untimely deaths, unless her daughter's ghost returned to the castle before Rowena's own death. Legend had it that a "broken heart" added to her early demise. This story may have had origin in her estrangement with her daughter. Rowena was the first of the founders to die<br>
        From her statue in Ravenclaw Tower and Xenophilius Lovegood's bust of her, Rowena was a beautiful yet austere-looking and slightly intimidating woman. She was tall, had pale skin, dark eyes, and long black hair. Rowena spoke in a pronounced Scottish accent.In Welsh poetry, Rowena is named <b>"mother of the nation"</b>, which could link in to her being a founder of Hogwarts. She also is another character whose name surfaces in the great epic Ivanhoe. Rowena, <b>Queen of Britain</b>, is a figure in Britain's traditional history; she was supposedly the daughter of Hengest and the wife of Vortigern. When Lady Rowena dies, he watches as she comes back to life in the form of his first wife.
